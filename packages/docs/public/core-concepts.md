# Core Concepts

## Features

Sextant is organised into **features** - descriptions of what your system can do. Let's say you're building a blog where users can do two things:

1. Fetch posts
2. Add comments to the posts

These two things are features of your application. Some applications may have only a few features, some may have tens or hundreds.

## Scenarios

**Scenarios** are ways that your features can behave. Let's imagine that your 'fetch posts' feature can behave in two ways:

1. Fetch the posts successfully
2. Fail to find the post your asked for

You would express both of these scenarios in different 'scenario diagrams' in Sextant.

> The names of 'features' and 'scenarios' were inspired by the [Gherkin language](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/), and BDD as a whole.

## Actors

Unless your application is very simple, it will likely be composed of multiple parts. For instance, the blog above has:

1. A frontend static site which fetches the posts
2. A database where posts are stored
3. A server which sits in between and acts as an intermediary

In Sextant, we call these **actors**. Actors don't have to be split along deployment lines. You might declare several actors within a single frontend application, or on a single server.

## Events

Actors can communicate with each other by sending messages. In Sextant, these are called **events**. Let's describe the scenario where a user fetches posts successfully:

1. The `frontend` actor sends a `GET_POSTS` event to the `server`
2. The `server` sends `GET_POSTS_FROM_DATABASE` to the `database`
3. The `database` sends back a `POSTS` event to the `server`
4. The `server` then forwards that on to the `frontend`

Events are the core currency of Sextant - everything that happens in your application is an event between two actors. Different sequences of events lead to different scenarios, which help describe all the behaviours of a feature.

### Type safety with GraphQL

Events can be fully typed using GraphQL. For instance, `GET_POSTS` might be typed like this:

```graphql
type GET_POSTS {
  postId: ID!
}
```

Which would yield this event in JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "GET_POSTS",
  "postId": "some-id"
}
```
