# Sextant

Chart your application flows, then implement them as typesafe code.

Sextant is currently in an experimental, proof-of-concept stage. We're looking for feedback, and passionate open-source contributors to help.

## Getting Started

[See the 'frontend' package](./packages/frontend) for more information about using Sextant.
