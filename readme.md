# Sextant

Chart your application flows, then implement them as typesafe code.

Sextant is currently in an experimental, proof-of-concept stage. We're looking for feedback, and passionate open-source contributors to help.

## Getting Started

[See the 'frontend' package](./packages/frontend) for more information about using Sextant.

## Local development

1. Install yarn (version 1)
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn dev` to build all dependent packages and run Typescript on all repositories except `frontend`
4. Run `yarn fe start` to kick off the frontend dev server
